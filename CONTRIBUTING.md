# Contributing
This document contains information related to contributing to this project and codebase. 

**Please read through this document prior to participating in this project.**

## I want to contribute code
1. [Follow the steps to set up your development environment](https://github.com/VikeLabs/courseup/tree/aomi/docs/README-CONTRIBUTORS#develop).
2. [Pick an **unassigned** GitHub issue to work on](https://github.com/VikeLabs/courseup/issues).
    * If you are a first time contributer, the [good first issue](https://github.com/VikeLabs/courseup/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) tag is a useful place to start!
    * Have discussions about the issue within the comment section of that issue!
3. Create a new branch using `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
    * Tip: Make sure you're up to date with `main`.
    * Tip: Try to use a descriptive branch name.
4. Commit the changes you've made and push to GitHub to create a Pull Request using the templates provided.
    * Make sure you are clear with the changes and note anything that would be useful for the reviewer to know.
    * Your PR doesn't have to be perfect right from the start so don't sweat. Coding is an iterative process with plenty of back and forth.
5. Communicate with maintainers and the community in [CourseUp's discussion](https://github.com/VikeLabs/courseup/discussions)!

Experience with React, TypeScript, and other technologies the website is built on is useful but ***not*** required! Contributing to the project can help you build skills and gain experience writing in a company-like codebase. Picking issues with the `good first issue` tag and communicating in the various locations can go a long way.
